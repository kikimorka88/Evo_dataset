# Evo_dataset
Exploring the Hominin brain size
In this project I used a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santiago123678/evolution-of-humans-datasets-for-clasification).  
This is a data set deposited on Kaggle and contains gathered evolutionary information from archaic 
hominin species, including modern human. The data covers different biological features (numerical and categorical variables), evolutionary 
time (in millions of years ago) and location of the fossil findings.

# Questions to explore  
In this exciting data set, we can find many potential questions to explore the human past. As a 
neuroscientist, I would like to explore the correlations of brain size and behavioral traces of hominins. 
In the second line, I would have a look at other biological features that could be linked to cognitive 
evolution. Iâ€™ll start with a set of few questions, and I leave the door open to new questions that may 
arise during the analysis.
1. What is the cranial capacity in hominins over the evolutionary time? Is there any trend?
2. Is cranial capacity different between the geographical regions at the similar/different time 
points or in general?
...and many more but let's start with the most basic one.

# Jupyter notebooks  
I used Jupyter notebooks to work with the data.
